Make it easy to convey what frameworks you are using. Do it by keeping your README.md file up to date with the badges of the tools you are using.

```bash
pnpx auto-badge-addition     
```

or

```bash
npx auto-badge-addition     
```


**NOTE: The package doesn't use Vite. It just exists as an example here.**
